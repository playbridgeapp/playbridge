## 2025-02-09 - XSS Vulnerability in Extension Popup
**Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability in `extension/src/ui/popup.js` where user-controlled connection properties (`ip`, `pin`) were rendered directly into the DOM using `item.innerHTML = \`<span class="saved-connection-ip">${conn.ip}</span>\``.
**Learning:** The extension builds some DOM views manually without a UI framework, increasing the risk of DOM-based XSS when interpolating variables into HTML strings.
**Prevention:** Always use safe DOM API methods (`document.createElement` and `textContent`) or a sanitization library instead of interpolating untrusted input into `innerHTML`.

## 2026-07-21 - Local File Access Vulnerability in TV App
**Vulnerability:** The Android TV app's `SystemWebViewEngine` had `allowFileAccess` set to `true`. This is a high-risk security misconfiguration because it allows the arbitrary web content loaded into the system WebView to access and read local files on the device filesystem.
**Learning:** The WebView should be treated as untrusted, especially since it's used as a browser to navigate to arbitrary URLs. Giving it file system access unnecessarily expands the attack surface for potential XSS or path traversal attacks to access sensitive application data.
**Prevention:** Explicitly configure `allowFileAccess = false` on all WebViews that handle remote, untrusted content unless there is a verified, strict requirement for local file access (and even then, restrict it securely).
