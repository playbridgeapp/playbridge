## 2025-02-09 - XSS Vulnerability in Extension Popup
**Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability in `extension/src/ui/popup.js` where user-controlled connection properties (`ip`, `pin`) were rendered directly into the DOM using `item.innerHTML = \`<span class="saved-connection-ip">${conn.ip}</span>\``.
**Learning:** The extension builds some DOM views manually without a UI framework, increasing the risk of DOM-based XSS when interpolating variables into HTML strings.
**Prevention:** Always use safe DOM API methods (`document.createElement` and `textContent`) or a sanitization library instead of interpolating untrusted input into `innerHTML`.

## 2026-07-21 - Local File Access Vulnerability in TV App
**Vulnerability:** The Android TV app's `SystemWebViewEngine` had `allowFileAccess` set to `true`. This is a high-risk security misconfiguration because it allows the arbitrary web content loaded into the system WebView to access and read local files on the device filesystem.
**Learning:** The WebView should be treated as untrusted, especially since it's used as a browser to navigate to arbitrary URLs. Giving it file system access unnecessarily expands the attack surface for potential XSS or path traversal attacks to access sensitive application data.
**Prevention:** Explicitly configure `allowFileAccess = false` on all WebViews that handle remote, untrusted content unless there is a verified, strict requirement for local file access (and even then, restrict it securely).

## 2025-02-09 - Insecure Mixed Content Policy in TV App WebView
**Vulnerability:** The Android TV app's `SystemWebViewEngine` had `mixedContentMode` set to `WebSettings.MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW`. This is a critical security risk as it permits the loading of insecure active content (like scripts and iframes) over HTTP within a secure HTTPS context, exposing the app to Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks and XSS.
**Learning:** `MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW` should never be used in a WebView that loads remote, untrusted content, as it completely disables the browser's mixed content protections.
**Prevention:** Always use `WebSettings.MIXED_CONTENT_COMPATIBILITY_MODE` (or `MIXED_CONTENT_NEVER_ALLOW`) for WebViews to ensure the browser blocks active insecure content from loading on secure origins.

## 2026-07-21 - Local Content Provider Access Vulnerability in TV App
**Vulnerability:** The Android TV app's `SystemWebViewEngine` had `allowContentAccess` set to `true`. This is a critical security misconfiguration because it allows the arbitrary web content loaded into the system WebView to access and read local content provider data via `content://` URIs on the device, potentially exposing sensitive application data or internal processes (e.g. `PlayerProcessBridgeProvider`).
**Learning:** Just as `allowFileAccess` is dangerous, `allowContentAccess` is equally risky when a WebView acts as a browser to navigate to untrusted arbitrary URLs. It unnecessarily expands the attack surface.
**Prevention:** Explicitly configure `allowContentAccess = false` on all WebViews that handle remote, untrusted content to prevent access to the application's ContentProviders.

## 2024-05-18 - [Token Storage Security & Safe Migrations]
**Vulnerability:** PlayBridge tokens were being persisted in plaintext within preferences stores. When migrating to hash-based verification, there is a risk of introducing length-based "pass-the-hash" bypasses during authentication logic if not handled explicitly.
**Learning:** Checking for string length differences to distinguish raw vs hashed tokens enables pass-the-hash attacks. Instead, authentication logic should immediately verify the hash first, falling back to plaintext only to transparently perform a one-way inline migration without exposing branch conditionals to malicious tokens.
**Prevention:** Avoid length checks or generic bypass branches when migrating tokens. Implement exact-match verification on the new hashed token, followed by exact-match verification on the raw legacy token—subsequently performing the migration logic (replace old with new hash) when a raw token is legitimately verified.
